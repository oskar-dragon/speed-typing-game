## General Information

This simple game is used to practice your speed typing. The rules area pretty straight forward. Once you press start, a text will appear in an input field and you have tot type it in the exact same way that it appears on the screen. Once time is up, you will see a number of words you've typed in

I have made this project with React in order to practice the hooks (`useReducer`, `useEffect`, `useRef` and custom hooks).

## Technologies Used

- React.js - version 17.0.2

## General Information
This simple game is used to practice your speed typing. The rules area pretty straight forward. Once you press start, you've got 15 seconds to type in a sentence. Once time is up, you will see a number of words you've typed in.

I have made this project with React in order to practice the hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, custom hooks).


## Technologies Used
- React.js - version 17.0.2


## Screenshots

## Setup
To be able to set up and run this application in your local environment, use `npm run start`


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_.


## Room for Improvement

**Room for Imrovement**:
- Hooks could be moved to seperate files

**To do**:
- [] Add an option to change remaining time
- [] Use sentence that user needs to type in and check for errors
- [] Show previous score so users can check if they are making any improvements
- [] Move hooks to seperate files
